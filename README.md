breakdown:
Frontend Mastery 🚀:
 I chose React for its unbeatable flexibility and paired it with Vite for lightning-fast builds. TailwindCSS gave me a clean, responsive interface without the overhead, while Zustand kept state management lean and efficient.
Backend ⚙️:
 On the server side, Express running on Node.js delivered robust, scalable APIs. PostgreSQL was the clear choice for data storage—reliable, precise, and built to handle heavy-duty transactions.
Security & Real-Time Edge 🔒:
 I secured the system with JWT, ensuring ironclad authentication. I also integrated Firebase to unlock real-time features and streamline backend services.
